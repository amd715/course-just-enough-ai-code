You know you’ve really made it when your zip code does the talking. In Delhi-NCR, that means one thing: DLF Camellias - at least for now. And the Jaggi brothers, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, now in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, couldn’t resist the lure either.

The Jaggi brothers, behind Gensol Engineering and co-founders of BluSmart (India’s first all-electric cab service), are in hot water. SEBI (the market regulator) has accused them of seriously misusing funds. Instead of using the money for the growth of their EV business, it was allegedly spent on personal luxuries - buying flats in The Camellias being one of them.

While the cynosure is, of course, the huge sum of money squandered, people can’t help but pause for a moment and ask: what is it about this ultra-luxurious condominium that sets a benchmark even for the creme de la creme of the country?

The allure of arrival
For many in Delhi-NCR's elite circles, The Camellias represents more than just a real estate investment, it’s a symbol of having arrived. “It’s not about flamboyance,” says Sahil Verma, COO of Shray Projects. “It’s about refinement, discretion, and timelessness.” From curated Aravalli views to sustainability credentials and bespoke finishes, Camellias is built not to impress, but to quietly exude excellence.

“Camellias isn’t just a home. It’s a statement that you’ve made it,” says Mohit Minocha, a Delhi-based realtor and founder of South Delhi Floors. “Just paying for the property means you’re also paying for the name, the prestige, the recognition that comes with it.”

The Camellias is home to India’s highest net-worth individuals - from startup founders to sporting legends to CEOs and executives. You are sure to rub shoulders with the who’s who of not just Delhi-NCR but the nation, to be precise. It is a highly prominent symbol of Indian HNIs’ aspiration when it comes to ultra-luxury homes, Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Group, explains.

The location, he mentions, is Gurugram’s Golf Course Road, which is a high-value vanity pin code in its own right and also very conveniently near the region’s important business hubs. The price points themselves act as a social filter that lets only the top layer through. Its premium amenities, including a private 9-hole golf course, spell ‘arrival’ like very little else can.

A gated network, not just a gated community
“Living here means being part of a hyper-curated ecosystem,” says Verma. The neighbours aren’t just rich, they’re influential. Industrialists, startup moguls, investors sharing club lounges and golf greens here isn’t just networking; it’s cultural capital. It’s also why Camellias commands a premium beyond typical luxury specs.

What’s pulling people to Camellias isn’t just the convenience of high-rise living—it’s the cachet that comes with the pin code. This is where the country’s power players live, network, and strike deals over evening walks. If you're chasing startup funding, you might not need to book a flight to Bengaluru (or go to Shark Tank India, for that matter), all you need to do is just book a table in the Camellias clubhouse, and you can get going. It’s less of a residence and more of an elite ecosystem - like LinkedIn, but for the ultrarich and influential.

In today’s world, where your associations and social standings mean everything, The Camellias only helps you access this association. At one point of time, what was Lutyens and South Delhi for the elite, it is safe to say that the entrepreneurial or corporate culture is witnessing a new epicentre of status, and that real clout now seems to come with a Gurugram pin code.

The FOMO factor and what it signals
Is Camellias' appeal purely emotional, driven by Fear of Missing Out? Partly, yes.

“Buyers may not even plan to live there immediately, but they want a piece of the pie,” says Puri. But it’s also pragmatic. In a post-pandemic world, ultra-luxury homes are being viewed as both a lifestyle upgrade and a solid asset class. Scarcity, security, and the brand equity of DLF all add layers to its long-term value. Because owning a condo in The Camellias isn’t just about where you live, it’s about who you are, and who you want to be seen with.

“Land is a limited resource, and this location can yield only so many such projects before becoming saturated. Also, its very presence will serve to tailor and preserve the immediate surroundings into a high-class neighbourhood where only the wealthiest will gain a foothold. Such luxury is not a sold-and-forgotten deal—it will see constant upgrades and consistently project the highest levels of luxury in vogue now and in the future,” adds Anuj Puri.

Puri’s comment on the FOMO factor finds resonance in Verma’s observation too, who notes that the demand is as emotional as it is aspirational. With limited inventory, soaring interest, and every resale pushing prices higher, the FOMO is very real, less about the property itself and more about what it signals: entry into an exclusive, elite circle.

More significantly, The Camellias captures a broader shift in how India’s wealthy are redefining luxury. It’s no longer just about plush interiors or premium amenities, it’s about belonging, trust, and social capital. And in that sense, The Camellias isn’t just part of the trend; it’s leading it.

Having worked closely with buyers at the top end of the real estate spectrum, Verma says it’s clear that choosing Camellias isn’t really about comparing features. No one’s picking it because it has a better pool or a shinier gym. It’s the name that does the talking. For most buyers, it marks a personal milestone. It’s rarely their first luxury home, but it’s the one they’ve always seen as the goal.
