Hyderabad: Telangana government expanded the reach of its AI-powered online building approval system to the entire Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) region.

Called `BuildNow’, the initiative is aimed at expediting approvals and cutting waiting time.

“The move is intended to expedite approvals for a greater number of people. It is a part of the state's digital governance objectives. With its rollout in Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) areas next week, Telangana is setting an example in urban development reforms," said M Dana Kishore, Principal Secretary, MA&UD.

What is BuildNow?

Elaborating, he said that ‘BuildNow’ automates building plan approvals and cuts processing time from days to seconds.

In comparison to the TGbPASS, the time required for building plan inspection in BuildNow has decreased, from several days to a few minutes. This rapid inspection is one of BuildNow's primary benefits. Approvals are often obtained within 30 seconds.

A recent 26-floor high-rise proposal, which included six towers and an amenity block totaling more than 2 lakh square meters, was approved in just 71 seconds on Friday, he said.

BuildNow's main advantage is that it is India's fastest drawing scrutiny system. TGbPASS lacked the functionality of a 24/7 AI-powered application support.

MA&UD Principal Secretary also said that the system now includes Future City and its surrounding towns, among other new regions. Instant registration, single-window clearance, and Occupancy Certificates (OC) issuance are all available services. Since its inception last month, more than 500 applications have been processed under GHMC guidelines, he said.

TGbPASS provided customer service support on working days from 10 am to 5.30 p.m., but BuildNow provides real-time status updates via WhatsApp, making it a citizen-centric program. The technology runs without human interaction, which ensures transparency and reduces delays, he added.
